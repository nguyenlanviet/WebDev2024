        <p> The Ronaldo father-son duo currently belong to Al-Nassr, with the 39-year-old playing for the senior team in the Saudi Pro League whilst the 14-year-old plays for the development team in the Middle Eastern nation.
            
            And the man with 1,242 career appearances under his belt is keen to ensure his child looks after his body in the best way possible, as he pushed the budding soccer player in their private gym after grilling him about the amount of time he spent in bed.
            
            "Muscle up, five exercises, carpet, five exercises, carpet," Ronaldo told his kid. "One hour, I'm going to do the same as you.
        
            "There are three series of two minutes that is a total of six. Do two minutes, do it at the same time. You make a belt and I make another and we do it at the same time."

            The pair took to the lateral pulldown machine before heading to other areas of the gym to continue developing the teenager's muscles, to give him a physical advantage over his rivals on the field. 
        
            Ronaldo will let his kid do "whatever he chooses to do"
            
            Real Madrid's greatest ever player has often been criticized for his approach to his children, with claims suggesting he's too strict and isn't allowing them to be children yet the five-time UEFA Champions League winner doesn't feel this is the case.

            "My son has potential," Ronaldo told media. "We'll see if he will become a great footballer. Sometimes he drinks coke and eats crisps and it irritates me.

            "I just want him to be the best in whatever he chooses to do. I always tell him, hard work is the most important."
