        <p>The Brazilian fighter secured a TKO victory over Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 307, maintaining his heavyweight championship title.

            Alex Pereira successfully defended his UFC heavyweight championship after defeating Khalil Rountree Jr. by TKO at UFC 307 in Salt Lake City, finishing the fight with a series of powerful strikes in the fourth round. In the same event, Mario Bautista triumphed over Jose Aldo, Kayla Harrison overcame Ketlen Vieira, and Julianna Pena became the UFC women’s bantamweight champion for the second time.
            
            Rountree Jr. gave Pereira a tough time in the second round, knocking down the reigning champion with a strong right punch. However, Pereira recovered and ended the fight with a flurry of powerful punches in a dramatic fourth round. This marked Pereira's third successful title defense since winning his second title, bringing his overall UFC record to 9-1. Meanwhile, Julianna Pena became the UFC women’s bantamweight champion for the second time with a split decision victory over Raquel Pennington. The match was intense, with Pennington landing several strong punches, but Pena showcased her superior skills by taking her opponent down. After the fight, Pena was scored higher by two of the three judges to secure the win.
            
            "I think I did enough to win," Pena said at the post-fight press conference. "Staying calm and flexible like water, as my jiu-jitsu coach often says, helped me turn the fight around. I know I'm strong, resilient, and I will never give up. You really have to beat me to make me stop."
            
            Mario Bautista made a significant mark with one of the biggest wins of his career, defeating Jose Aldo by split decision, extending his winning streak to seven fights. Roman Dolidze also achieved a TKO victory over Kevin Holland after Holland suffered a rib injury in the first round.
            
            Kayla Harrison, who won Olympic gold medals in judo at London 2012 and Rio 2016, also claimed victory over Ketlen Vieira by unanimous decision, despite Vieira putting up a tough fight.</p>
