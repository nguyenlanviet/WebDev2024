        <p>On Monday at Outernet London, a press conference promoting the Beterbiev vs. Bivol fight took place in a vibrant atmosphere. Boxing enthusiasts have eagerly awaited this day: June 1, 2024!

            This is the date when the "unification bout in the light heavyweight division" will occur between Beterbiev (holder of the WBA, IBF, and WBO titles) and Bivol (holder of the WBC title). Additionally, both fighters will compete for The Ring title and the Lineal Championship position from the magazine.
            
            The savvy promoter Eddie Hearn, who is also Bivol's co-manager, stated, "In every weight class, we should identify the undisputed Champion. It will tell you who the best is here!"
            
            Currently, there is no doubt left: in the third heaviest weight class in professional boxing (behind heavyweight and super middleweight), Beterbiev and Bivol are the only two capable of participating in this "summit conference."
            
            Beterbiev (with an unblemished record of 20 wins by KO) is the top fighter in this weight class and ranks fifth overall, regardless of weight. Meanwhile, Bivol (with a perfect record of 22 wins, 11 by KO) is recognized as the second-best in this weight class and holds The Ringâ€™s Lineal Championship. He also ranks fifth overall.
            
            Each fighter has held at least one major championship title since 2017, coincidentally the last year Andre Ward held The Ring's light heavyweight title (after defeating Russia's Sergey Kovalev). The Ring title was left vacant after Ward retired.
            
            During Ward and Kovalev's reign, their bouts contested three major championship titles: WBA (Super), IBF, and WBO, missing only the WBC. At that time, the WBC light heavyweight title was held by Adonis Stevenson, who lost it to Oleksandr Gvozdyk in 2018. He had previously been stripped of the title...
            
            The absence of a "champion" in the light heavyweight division and the lack of a "unification bout" is due to fighters belonging to different organizations, and these organizations have contracts with various television networks. It has been challenging to negotiate shared rights and benefits.
            
            Beterbiev and Bivol share a similar fate, despite having seen each other over the past seven years. Bivol primarily fights on DAZN through an alliance with Matchroom Boxing, while Beterbiev remains loyal to ESPN via Top Rank.
            
            After numerous complications, including their inability to face each other earlier this year, they are finally here, face to face, expressing gratitude to the fight promoter, Turki Alalshikh.
            
            Bivol explained, "In boxing, we know what happens. All the champions work with Top Rank. I asked my team to pursue this fight... Then I received the response that no one would facilitate the matchup."</p>
