            At 49, Beckham recently participated in a Hugo Boss campaign, his first for the brand, alongside prominent models Naomi Watts and Gisele.

            As Beckham has taken on the role of ambassador for BOSS, the prospect of future projects with BÃ¼ndchen appears imminent, further complicating his relationship with Brady.        

            The insider emphasized that Beckham's push into the fashion realm could stir rivalry between the two sports icons.

            "Working with Gisele sends a clear message to the media that David is serious about establishing himself as a lasting figure in fashion and sports, and Tom might see him as a primary competitor," the source noted.

            This development is surprising for fans who have closely followed the competitive dynamics between Beckham and Brady.

            Although Brady announced his retirement from professional football "for good" in February 2023, he remains driven and is now focusing on broadcasting and building his personal brand.

            "Tom and David have long been competing for the same audience," the insider explained to In Touch.

            "However, with Tom retired, the landscape has changed as he seeks to make a name for himself in broadcasting."
            
            Despite the potential for numerous endorsement deals for both stars, Beckham's alliance with Gisele could create tension between them.

            The former couple, once considered a power duo, finalized their divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage, during which Brady won seven Super Bowl titles and Gisele appeared on the covers of over 1,200 magazines.

            The court declared their marriage "irretrievably broken" on the same day they filed for divorce.

            Brady has been sensitive about the split, particularly regarding jokes made about Gisele during his Netflix roast.

            Furthermore, the insider revealed that Brady is actively using his broadcasting platform to settle scores with other players, showcasing his competitive spirit.
             
            "While they may claim to be friends, David doesn't share the same competitive edge as Tom," the source remarked.

            "He doesn't feel the need to criticize former teammates in order to maintain his success. That's a significant difference between them." </p>
