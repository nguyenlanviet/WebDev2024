            Jennifer Lopez has undergone a drastic makeover as the On The Floor singer looks to rebound back to form after filing for divorce from Ben Affleck, two years after the couple got married in 2022.

            Bennifer had been on the ropes through late 2023 and into 2024 and it was finally confirmed that their time was coming to an end on August 20 when the 55-year-old mother-of-two filed the documents in Los Angeles, as well as revealing they had been separated since April.
        
            Despite a brief chance of reconciliation between the pair at the Beverly Hills Hotel in September, it seems as though their legal split will be going ahead after Affleck moved to Pacific Palisades whilst they didn't spend their birthdays or anniversary together.

            So the model and actress aims to make her ex-husband jealous by wearing randy clothing and getting a makeover to remind the Batman star just how exactly he's choosing to walk away from after four years.
            
            "J Lo is doing what millions of other divorcees do," a source told RadarOnline.com. "Getting a glow-up after their splits.
            
            "But she has millions at her disposal, and is determined to look better than ever - so Ben will see what he is missing."
            
            The star had reportedly wanted eye surgery for some time but delayed it in order to focus on her marriage with the 52-year-old Pearl Harbor actor and on her own busy schedule, relating to her failed tour attempt.
            
            So Lopez, who has a net worth of approximately $400,000 through her career in modelling, music and acting, will splash some of the cash on underdoing LASIK eye surgery to make sure she can see the world and all its color in 20/20 vision.
            
            "Jen wanted to ditch the glasses and contacts," the source added. "[She's] aiming for a fresh start and a new outlook on life.
            
            "She decided it was time to do something just for herself, and what better way to kick off this new phase than by literally seeing the world more clearly?"
