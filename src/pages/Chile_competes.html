            The country was nominated as a Nature, Green, Romantic, Adventure Tourism and Leading City Destination by Santiago de Chile, which were recently recognized in the regional version of the so-called "Tourism Oscars".

            Chile has once again consolidated its position as a key destination on the international scene, with 5 nominations in the 31st version of the World Travel Awards (WTA), one of the most prestigious awards in the global tourism industry. This recognition not only highlights the diversity and quality of the country's tourist attractions, but also reinforces its image before the world as a destination that leads in sustainability, adventure and excellence in infrastructure.
            
            Chile's nominations are Best Adventure, Green, Romantic and Nature Destination, as well as Leading City, categories that were awarded in previous editions, such as the regional awards of the so-called "Oscars of Tourism", whose online voting closes on October 20 and can be accessed through "Chile is yours".  
       
            Rossana Dresdner, executive director of Imagen de Chile, highlighted the importance of these awards in strengthening the country's international reputation. "The nominations in the World Travel Awards are a very important opportunity to continue positioning Chile as a unique, innovative, diverse destination, committed to sustainability and the quality of its services. We have been recognized before for our attractive tourism proposal and I hope we will be recognized again. We are a destination for sightseeing, knowledge and learning, but also for doing business, investing and international cooperation," he said.
           
            A track record of success

            Chile has been awarded in several editions of the World Travel Awards. In particular, it has won the title of Best Adventure Destination globally on several consecutive occasions, standing out for the variety of experiences it offers, from the Atacama Desert to Patagonia. It has also been recognized as Best Green Destination and has received awards in categories related to ecotourism and sustainable tourism, which has reinforced its image as a country committed to protecting the environment.
      
            In addition to this, there are a dozen awards for hotel and convention infrastructure, areas that have also seen significant growth in recent years, positioning Chile as a key destination for business tourism and international events.

            The awards gala, where the winners will be announced, will be held on November 24 in Madeira, Portugal.
