            The US economy is growing after the surge of Covid-19.

            Data from the Commerce Department show that the United States grew 5.7% in economic matters. The fastest-growing performance since 1984.
        
            From October to December, the Gross Domestic Product rose to 6.9% on an annualized basis.

            "The GDP numbers for my first year show that we are finally building an American economy for the 21st Century, with the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades, along with the greatest year of job growth in American history," said Joe Biden in a statement. "And, for the first time in 20 years, our economy grew faster than China's."
            
            Figures also show that Joe Biden is the president with more jobs created in a first-year performance.
            
            President Biden generated 6.4 million jobs during his first year at the White House, helping to accomplish the largest calendar-year drop in unemployment ever.
        
            Analysts believe growth will slow in 2022. The World Bank is predicting a 3.7% of growth in the United States this year.
        
            "The defining challenge for the economy in the next year or two will be how well we can sustain growth not just in the absence of fiscal policy, but in the face of tightening monetary policy," Wells Fargo economists wrote in a research note.

            The Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates in 2022. Making it more expensive to buy a car, house, or carry a credit card debt. This move could slow the economy.
