            Can immigrants to the United States claim stimulus checks from the federal government and states in a bid to make ends meet as the colder months approach, as well as the turbulent cost of living crisis?

            Stimulus checks aim to "stimulate" (promote) economic activity from the population by offering them a sum of month that they can use to ensure they avoid going homeless, without essential items or to simply encourage them to shop and invest in the economy
       
            Perhaps the most famous example in recent years are the executive COVID-19 stimulus checks distributed to those the federal government predicts would be struggling through the economic times, which is worth $1400 each.

            Single-filers have a maximum income limit of $80,000 and those married and filing jointly have a maximum income limit of $160,000. Additionally, heads of household are capped at a maximum of $120,000.
            
            To claim, a resident with a social security number of permission to reside in the United States should file their 2020 and 2021 taxes as soon as possible and they have until April 18. 2025 to claim any missed stimulus checks through the Recovery Rebate Credit.
            
            Additionally, stimulus checks can be used to encourage residents and citizens to invest in areas of the economy the government needs for one reason or another, such as hitting climate change targets through distributing electrical vehicles or heat pumps to replace gas/electric boilers.
        
            But can immigrants also claim this stimulus? The answer is yes. The final round of COVID-19 stimulus payments which are due to be sent out in the latter two months of 2024. All a person has to do to claim is to be married with, or the dependent of, a resident holding an eligible social security number.

            Or be a permanent resident, or qualifying resident alien. That will allow an immigrant to claim up to $1,400 individually for the check. For example, a household of four could claim up to $5,600 from the government.
