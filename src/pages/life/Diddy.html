            College student alleges Diddy raped and then threatened to kill her as new wave of lawsuits emerge

            Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is now facing a new wave of lawsuits, with six more alleged victims coming forward on Monday.

            Among them are four men and two women, including one who was just 16 years old at the time of the alleged incidents. The cases, filed in Manhattan federal court, claim that Combs' sexual misconduct spanned from 1995 to 2021, deepening the legal woes of the embattled star, who is already facing sex-trafficking charges. 
            
            One of the plaintiffs, identified as Jane Doe, claims she was 19 years old and a college freshman when she was assaulted by Combs in 2004. According to the lawsuit, she and a friend attended a photoshoot event for "Da Band," a group signed to Combs' label. After the event, they were invited to an "exclusive party" at Combs' hotel. However, once they arrived, the situation quickly turned sinister.
       
            What did the filings state?

            Court filings state that the two women were escorted to a separate room by a security guard, who locked them in and ominously said, "You know what you are here for." The lawsuit alleges that Combs then entered the room, offering them drinks and cocaine before threatening to kill them if they did not comply with his demands.
        
            He allegedly forced one of the women's friends to perform oral sex on him while threatening both their lives.

            The plaintiff, Jane Doe, says she begged Combs to stop as he assaulted her, but he continued to rape her despite her pleas. After a security guard briefly entered the room to check on the situation, the plaintiff's friend managed to escape. Jane Doe was left alone in the room for over an hour before another security guard finally allowed her to leave, according to the suit.
        
            All of the plaintiffs in the new lawsuits are seeking unspecified damages. This latest legal action comes as Combs, 54, awaits his May trial on sex-trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case and continues to maintain his innocence amid the growing number of civil lawsuits.

            As these new accusations surface, the legal challenges for the once-powerful music icon continue to escalate, casting a long shadow over his career and legacy.
