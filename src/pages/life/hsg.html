        <p>On the afternoon of October 6, the Hanoi Department of Education and Training welcomed a delegation of students from Hanoi representing Vietnam at the 2024 International Mathematics and Science Olympiad (IMSO) - the 21st edition.

            This year's competition achieved the highest results ever, with all 24 members of the delegation winning awards, including 2 outstanding prizes in the Exploration and Theory exams, 9 Gold Medals, 14 Silver Medals, and 1 Bronze Medal (an increase of 1 Gold Medal and 1 Silver Medal compared to the 2023 IMSO results).
            
            With a 100% medal-winning rate, the Vietnamese team ranked second overall. The 2024 IMSO took place from October 1 to October 6 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, with participation from 18 countries and 300 competitors.
            
            The 2024 IMSO is particularly special as it marks the return to in-person competition after three years of online exams and is held nearly two months earlier than usual.
            
            This early scheduling led to a rushed preparation for the team, as the new school year in Vietnam had just begun a month prior. However, the organization of student selection through various rounds, as well as the final selection of team members, was carried out systematically and thoroughly.
            
            The Vietnamese team comprises 24 students from both public and private elementary and middle schools in Hanoi. Overcoming many outstanding competitors from 18 countries, the team achieved the highest results to date.
            
            These accomplishments not only showcase the students' exceptional thinking and knowledge but also reflect the pride of Vietnamese education in general and Hanoi specifically.
            
            Notably, this year's team members came from a variety of school types, clearly reflecting the quality of public and private middle schools in Hanoi.
            
            The outstanding performance of the Vietnamese team has left a positive impression of Hanoi and Vietnam on the international stage.</p>
