            Taylor Swift's Holiday surprise
            
            The 34-year-old superstar announced two major releases, including a physical edition of her latest album and an official book documenting her tour.
             
            Both products will be available exclusively at Target this Black Friday.

            Swift made the surprise announcement via Instagram and "Good Morning America," expressing her excitement about commemorating the tour in two special ways.
        
            "We'll be kicking off the final leg of The Eras Tour this week, which is hard to comprehend,"Swift wrote.

            "This tour has been the most wondrous experience and I knew I wanted to commemorate the memories we made together in a special way. Well, two ways actually."
        
            The first of those is an extended "Anthology" version of her April-released album, The Tortured Poets Department.

            This new edition includes four additional acoustic tracks and will be available on CD and vinyl for the first time.

            The vinyl set features four marbled, translucent LPs, retailing at $59.99, while the CD version is priced at $17.99.

            In addition, Swift will be releasing Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book, a 256-page collection featuring over 500 photos, behind-the-scenes images, and personal reflections from the tour.

            The book offers fans an in-depth look at the creative process behind the three-hour show, which covers Swift's 11 albums and features elaborate production and costume changes.

            Priced at $39.99, the book will hit stores on Nov. 29, with online availability beginning the following day
