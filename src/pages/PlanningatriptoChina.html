            Traveling to China as a foreigner isn’t the simplest affair.


            Visa applications can be complicated, while international flights are limited and more expensive right now due to lower demand and higher costs for many airlines to fly around Russian airspace.


            And once you manage to wade through all of that, navigating this highly automated society with its own digital ecosystem can be intimidating – particularly for first-time visitors.


            But things may be changing.


            China has been amping up efforts to lure international travelers since reopening its doors following the pandemic at the end of 2022 by introducing more welcoming policies – and it’s asked the private sector to help, too.


            The country now offers visa exemptions for dozens of nationalities, as well as a 144-hour visa-free transit policy at a growing number of ports of entry.

            Meanwhile, mobile wallet giants like Alipay and WeChat have made their apps and payment processes more foreigner-friendly by simplifying their lengthy set-up processes and accepting international credit cards.


            Hotels and attractions are also being asked to accept international credit cards, which aren’t popular among merchants in China. Some cities like Beijing have launched all-in-one passes that allow travelers to electronically pay for things like attraction admissions and public transit.


            Looking at the stats alone, these measures seem to be working.


            China welcomed about 14 million foreign visitors in the first half of 2024, a 152.7% increase from 2023, according to the country’s National Immigration Administration. Around half of those travelers entered the country under various types of visa-free policies.


            The number is still a long way off from 2019 figures, when some 98 million foreign visitors traveled to the country, but some in the industry are encouraged by the upward trend.


            “Thanks to the new 15-day visa-free policy for some countries, we have seen an increase of tourists from those countries in the last year or so,” says Denny Tian, a travel specialist and manager at The China Guide, a Beijing-based private-tour travel agency.

            Gabriela Correia, 25, a doctor from Portugal, visited Shanghai and Beijing in June this year with her American boyfriend, entering the country under the 144-hour visa-free transit policy. It allows travelers from 54 countries (including Portugal and the US) on their way to a third country to make a stopover in one of several designated Chinese regions for up to six days.


            “It is important to note that planning a trip to China comes with more challenges than most places in the world,” says Correia, who has visited 47 countries so far.


            “The amount of information you find online is limited due to the relatively small number of Westerners going to China and because Google Maps is restricted in China.”


            Travel specialist Tian tells CNN Travel the language barrier has long been a big challenge for international travelers.


            “Many places only have Chinese information,” he says. “Most of the service staff do not speak English.”


            But he says there are ways to overcome these difficulties like downloading a translator app. Meanwhile, some airports have been making an extra effort by hiring multilingual staff to welcome visitors in different languages.

            “Not knowing Chinese definitely came with its challenges but I would say that made this trip even more fun,” says Correira.
            
            “People are very welcoming and make an effort to make it work. We had a lovely experience in a tea specialty restaurant even though none of the workers could speak English. We used the Google Translate photo feature to translate the menu and made it work out. We ended up getting cheesecake while we thought we were getting cheese bread for starters but who doesn’t like to have an extra dessert?”
            
            The doctor says she used a travel SIM card that came with a virtual private network (VPN) to access her usual mobile apps such as Google Translate. (More on this in the Q&A section below.)
            
            Correira also notes that many restaurants ask diners to order through a QR code that is linked to Alipay, which now has a translation function incorporated into the app, allowing foreign visitors to know what’s on the menu.
            
            Although the couple managed to have a great time traveling independently without knowing Chinese, they decided to hire a private guide for their visit to the Great Wall “as it facilitates logistics and allows you to go to (lesser-traveled) sections of the Wall.”
